This is an [Android](http://www.android.com) application that lets you control a [Boxee](http://www.boxee.tv) or [XBMC](http://www.xbmc.org) service from your phone. These two programs make it much easier to use a computer connected to a TV for videos and music.

The easiest way to install the remote is from the Android market.

**If you have problems**, please report them here, or by email. If you have a feature request or found a bug, [report it](http://code.google.com/p/boxeeremote/issues/list). I won't see things you report in the Android marketplace comments.

Features
  * Works with either Boxee or XBMC
  * Navigate using your phone's trackball or using buttons on the touchscreen.
  * Enter text with your phone's keyboard.
  * Shows the thumbnail, title, and time of the currently playing item (boxee-only)

I've had requests to add an "quit" button to the app, but in Android apps can't really exit. Doing so would be awkward and goes against how Android apps are supposed to work.
