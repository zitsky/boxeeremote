# Installation #

If you haven't already done so, install the application from the Android Market on your phone.

**If you have problems**, please report them here, or by email. If you have a feature request or found a bug, [report it](http://code.google.com/p/boxeeremote/issues/list). I won't see requests in the marketplace comments.

# Setting Up Boxee #

Hopefully you've already installed [Boxee](http://www.boxee.tv/). Within Boxee, go to the Settings menu. Select Network, and then Servers. Within Servers, make sure that "Enable Web Server" is checked, and remember the value of "Web Server Port".

# Setting Up Boxee Remote #

First, connect your phone to the same wireless network as your Boxee machine belongs to.

When you start the application on your phone is hit Menu and then choose "Scan for Boxees". Hopefully your boxee server is on the list. If not (or if you're using XBMC), go to the settings page (Menu->Settings) and enter the IP address or hostname of your Boxee computer. While at the settings page, I recommend turning off the Navigation Graphics, as they're horrible and the trackball works better.

# Controls #

You should be able to use the trackball to navigate around Boxee. Press in on the trackball to select an item, and press the back button (next to the Home key) to go back. If Boxee wants you to enter any text, you can type it in using your phone's keyboard.

The ringer volume buttons on your phone will control Boxee's volume, making it go up or down by 20% each push. But Boxee's volume control support is hit or miss and depends on what sort of content you're viewing, so this may not work well.
